          <div class="panel-body">This visualization shows which countries are happiest according to HPI data.
          The Happiness Index (visualized in the map) is measured  with several variables:
          Wellbeing, lifeExpectancy, Inequality of Outcomes and Ecological footprint.
          The map shows the world coloured on HPI index (happy=yellow, less happy=red).
          When hovering over the map the HPIrank is shown and the corresponding dot will light
          up in the scatterplot.
          This makes it easy to compare lifeExpectancy and wellbeing or inequality with the HPI
          score.
          To read more on how the HPI is calculated visit: http://happyplanetindex.org/
